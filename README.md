astrophysics of gaps in planetary rings: comparing classical and hyperbolic 1D advection-diffusion models for gap clearing

This is very much a WORK IN PROGRESS. The code architecture has not been finalized, and the physics is still being explored as well. It is no trivial matter to arrive at the effective continuum theory that one wishes to model. The rigorous results that most ppl are familiar with only hold in certain limits, and the entire point of this exercise is to go beyond those limits. (By way of an analogous example, I am only aware of recent work by Martin Ostoja-Starzewski at arriving at Maxwell-Cattaneo diffusion from a formal themodynamic analysis. The continuum theory in this domain is much more a matter of ansatz than it is formal derivation.)
